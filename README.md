# notforth -- a stack-based language for the AVR

`notforth` is an itty bitty language for the AVR. It's Forth-inspired, especially under the hood, but also draws heavily on postscript.

It supports a serial REPL, as well as ahead-of-time compilation of functions on the host, to be stored in flash on the AVR.
